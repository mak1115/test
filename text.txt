1. First I forked the project to commit to.
2. Cloned it to my IntelliJ
3. Next I created a branch and gave it a feature name
4. I added comments then commit and push to this version/feature
5. Then from github clicked compare and pull request
6. If there are no conflicts than the code can be merged!
